=head1 NAME

Games::Solitaire::BlackHole::Solver::Golf::App - a command line application
implemented as a class to solve the “Golf” variant of solitaire.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Games::Solitaire::BlackHole::Solver::Golf::App ();

    my $app = Games::Solitaire::BlackHole::Solver::Golf::App->new;

    $app->run();

And then from the command-line:

    $ golf-solitaire-solve-perl myboard.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This solves deals of
L<the "Golf" variant of patience and card solitaire|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(patience)> . It is not related to L<Code golf|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf>.
A script that encapsulates this application accepts a filename pointing
at the file containing the board or C<"-"> for specifying the standard input.

A board looks like this and can be generated for PySol FC using L<make_pysol_freecell_board.py|https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/blob/master/fc-solve/source/board_gen/make_pysol_freecell_board.py>

The Black Hole Solitaire Solvers homepage is at
L<http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/black-hole-solitaire-solver/>
and one can find there an implementation of this solver as a C library (under
the same licence), which is considerably faster and consumes less memory,
and has had some other improvements.
