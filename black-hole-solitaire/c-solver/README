Usage
-----

The format of a Black Hole board is similar to that:

-------------------------------------
Foundations: AS
QD JC TC
QC 8C 2S
KC 6C 3S
3C 8S TS
4C 4S 9H
2C 5D 2H
KD QH 3H
5C 7S AD
4D 9D 7H
JD KS 3D
JS 7C 5H
6H 6S 8D
QS 4H KH
6D AC 7D
2D 8H 5S
9C AH TH
TD 9S JH
-------------------------------------

Namely, the Foundations with the card at the foundation followed by the 17
columns, with up to three cards in each column. The initial boards for PySol
and PySolFC deals can be generated by the make_pysol_freecell_board.py
utility included in the Freecell Solver archive
( http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ ). Just remember to add the -t flag (and -F
if you want to generate PySolFC deals instead of the original PySol ones).

These solver can be called with such a board layout like this:

$ ./black-hole-solve --game black_hole 2.bh.board

Or:

$ make_pysol_freecell_board.py -F -t 2 black_hole | ./black-hole-solve --game black_hole

Similary "All in a Row" deals can be dealt using:

$ make_pysol_freecell_board.py -F -t 24 all_in_a_row | ./black-hole-solve --game all_in_a_row -
