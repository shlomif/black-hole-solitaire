Quick and Dirty Compilation
---------------------------

Black Hole Solitaire Solver is using CMake ( http://www.cmake.org/ )
for its build system. You'll need to install CMake version 2.6.3
or later from your distribution's repository or from its source
distribution. *NOTE*: CMake 2.6.2 (that ships with some releases of Ubuntu)
won't work due to a regression bug so please don't report any errors with
it.

Next, run:

    cmake-gui .         # For the GUI configuration applet

Or:

    ccmake .            # For the Curses-based configuration applet

With a fallback to:

    cmake .             # Non-interactive application.

This will build and install the "black_hole_solver" shared library,
and "black-hole-solve" which is the executable for you.

Installing under Win32
----------------------

Consult the CMake documentation for generating a Visual C++ , MinGW32
etc. compatible makefile or project.

-------

1. Configure it.

2. Build it.

3. Run "make test".
